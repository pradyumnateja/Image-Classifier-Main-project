# Image-Classifier-Main-project
In order the deploy a Web-App we need the following docs:
image_classifer.py
utils.py
procfile
mobilenet_model.h5
requirements.txt(In this text file you need to mention all the libraries that you are using in the project to deploy the app if you are using heroku).
setup.sh
I am using heroku for hosting it online on to the web.
Using Heroku CLI I am pushing all the above documents on to the heroku git in order to deploy the app on to the web.
If every requirement is satisfied and all the dependencies are installed your app gets hosted on to the web.
When the app is deployed you can upload any image from the given category and see your picture prediction dynamically.
